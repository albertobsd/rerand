Re-rand

This is a simple reimplementacion of the poor rand() function.

rand() depend of a srand() with a seed, usually we take the time(NULL) as seed but this is insecure, also is predictable the output of Pseudo-random values.

We add the posibilite the rerand implementation with Random or Static Map for the output values.
